# FED_AZ_201516

Material for my Docker Project and Master's thesis

Always use latest dockerfile for built (number index)
Analyse data via nipype and use a docker image for easy distribution and access.


Notes on processing:
1.(SPM DARTEL-based VBM) defacing over skull stripping! More robust and less chance of loss-of-brain-tissue
   FED022 and FED046 do have an early_scan directory.
   A couple of FED subjects seem to have additional T1 scans, probably due to leaving the scanner during the session ....
   The most consistent in all seems to be T1_MPRAGE_SAG_ISO_0_9_0005.
