FED: anatomical data
1. meeting with JBAllen, Hewig, Kollmannsberger, (J.Sanguinetti?) @ 10.06-10.07.19

Analyse data via nipype and use a docker image for easy distribution and access.



Notes on processing:
1. defacing over skull stripping! More robust and less chance of loss-of-brain-tissue

FED022 and FED046 do have an early_scan directory.

A couple of FED subjects seem to have additional T1 scans, probably due to leaving the scanner during the session ....

The most consistent in all seems to be T1_MPRAGE_SAG_ISO_0_9_0005.
