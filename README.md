# FED_AZ_201516

Material for my Docker Project and Master's thesis
Analyse data via nipype and use a docker image for easy distribution and access.

Always use latest dockerfile for built (number index)



Notes on processing:
1. FED022 and FED046 do have an early_scan directory;
   A couple of FED subjects seem to have additional T1 scans, probably due to leaving the scanner during the session ....
   The most consistent in all seems to be T1_MPRAGE_SAG_ISO_0_9_0005;
